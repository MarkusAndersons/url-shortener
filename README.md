# url-shortener
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MarkusAndersons/url-shortener.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MarkusAndersons/url-shortener)

A simple web app to produce and manage shortened URLs

This app is just a fun way for me to learn some Go.

## TODO
- Add further validation to given urls
- Add authentication to create url
- Persist generated URLs to disk
- Add concurrency safety to accessing the data store
- Deploy demo on Heroku (Docker?)
